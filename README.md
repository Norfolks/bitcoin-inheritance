# Bitcoin Inheritance
Decentralized way to make your bitcoins inherited to your relatives. You only need to know their bitcoin addresses.

## Scheme
You create an address from where you can spend bitcoins any time, but also any other member you specified can spend them too, but only after some big period of time - 1 year for example.
After one year, if you are fine, you withdraw bitcoins from the address and send them to another one with the same conditions, but other parties will have to wait for one more year to spend funds.
